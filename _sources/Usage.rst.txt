Usage
=====

CryDisGen can be run in Terminal by entering the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   CryDisGen parameter_file crystal_file

.. image:: img/usage.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center	

------

Note that the firt input paramater, ``parameter_file``, refers to the name of an ACSII text file 
containing the commands that specify the informaiton of the dislocatoins. The second paramater, ``crystal_file``, is the name of an ASCII text file providing the structural region where the dislocation will be inserted. Both files must be prepared by the user in advance. To write a ``parameter_file``, please refer to :doc:`Parameter file page <ParaFile>`. To prepare a ``crystal_file``, please use the :doc:`tools <Tools>` released with ``CryDigGen``.

After entering the above command in Terminal and pressing Enter, if no error occurs, an output file named ``outfile.lmp`` will be generated in the same locaiton where the command is executes. 
 
Both the input and output files of crystal structure can be directly read by `LAMMPS <https://www.lammps.org>`_ or visualzied by `OVITO <http://www.ovito.org>`_
